    <h1>2-May 2023: BYOD Policy Change</h1>
      <p>The school district recently sent out an email stating that students are now required to use school issued chromebooks rather than bringing their own laptop. This is stupid because the chromebooks are very slow and restrictive. The school also won't let students connect to the school network on their phones. The school issued chromebooks should be exclusively for students who are not able to afford their own laptop. to purposefully restrict the learning of students while spending more money on each student is stupid. I can't understand why this was even discussed as a choice. </p>

	  <p>For this Project, we created a program that sorts an array of words in the most efficient way we coild find. We used our own algorithm very similar to the merge sort algorithm to sort the array. We then compared the efficiency of our algorithm to the efficiency of the bubble sort algorithm. Our sort algorithm is more efficient than the bubble sort algorithm because it has a time complexity of O(n log n) while the bubble sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). We also compared the efficiency of our algorithm to the efficiency of the quick sort algorithm. Our algorithm is more efficient than the quick sort algorithm because it has a time complexity of O(n log n) while the quick sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). While it would have been easy to just copy the code off of the internet becuase merge sort is a very popular method of sorting data, all of the code (minus some help from W2Schools and StackOverflow for the basics) was written by me and my partners.<br />

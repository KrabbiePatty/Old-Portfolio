	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Caysen Mayo, Kyle Hernandez, Ibrahim Dier, Eric Steiner</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">     Although they are really confident in making a revolutionary game, there just isn't enough to convince me to join. I would probably join if there was any clarification in what makes this game the best or what kind of game it is. </p><br>
	  
	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/robel-abraham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">CarFinder</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Robel Abraham</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because this is probably already a product that has been produced. It also isn't too revolutionary when filtering systems on websites do basically the same thing. I think this needs some more brainstorming and polishing to bring this up to a marketable standard.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">Scheduling App (no name)</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Danelle Corbita, Renee Zachariah</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because the amount of competition for this app is immeasurable, each having something that makes them special. While this personalized schedule sounds interresting, I need some more information to be confident that this product will succeed in such an operpopulated market.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">TV360</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Austin Dlugosch</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because I don't think there was enough thought put into this. Tvs have never really needed 360 degrees of motion, so I am confused as to how this could improve the experience at all. I believe that this is just an overglorified wall mount that has new but ultimately useless functions.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">Eagle Card</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Aryan Kulkarni, Gaurav Jha</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because there is no need for this. It is basically serving the same purpose that a google bookmark can. I feel that this completely useless unless it is used like a business card or something similar, but even then I can just use a normal business card with a URL on it. I may not be seeing the vision that the group members have for this but I have no confidence in this product.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">Detect and Deter Drowsiness Inator (AKA Dx3)</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - William Clymire, Connor Church, Akshay Vemulapalli</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because although it may seem like a good idea, I think that this is a very risky business plan. It risks many drivers blaming the device for harming or shocking them and causing an accident. I don't see much success with this product.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shreya-kumar/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">The Restraunt Picker</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Shreya Kumar, Melanie Lopez de Nava Reza, Andrew Nguyen</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because it seems useless. If someone is having a hard pciking where to eat out, then they can go on uber eats or some other food delivery service and pick from their options.</p><br>

	  	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devon-leerson/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">Clicker Battle</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Devon Leerson</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because although games like this may have been popular a few years ago, the trend has long since died. While the simple design may attract some kids from younger age groups, the repetiveness will quickly run off the entire player base.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-elridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">Privacy Screen (no name)</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Andrew Elridge</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I rejected this because there are already products that can blur your screen when looking at it from an angle, or you can just turn the monitor off whenever someone might look at your computer. It seems like an overinvestment into a problem that is quite trivial.</p><br>

	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/Brett-Kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="font-size:23px">SchoolFood</a>
	  <b style="font-seize:23px"> - Brett Kaplan, Logan Rohlfs, Blake Gateley</b>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">I accepted this proposal because I believe that an online ordering system could be the solution to the grueling lunch lines. The only problem is employing enough delivery people, but it is ultimately inconsequential. I believe that this could solve long lunch in other large school districts just like Allen.</p><br>

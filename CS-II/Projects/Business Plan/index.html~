	  <b style="font-size:23px">Identity</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">SchoolFood manages an online system for the school cafeterias to be used by students.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Problem</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">The lines in the cafeteria often take more than twenty minutes to get food. This time could be spent more efficiently by the studuents in order <br>to advance their social skills, academic skills, etc. These times are caused by a buildup of students, cutting in line, and students' slow ordering.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Solution</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">Our solution is an online ordering system. It prevents cutting, allows students to talk with their friends or do some last-minute homework while <br>waiting for their food, and speeds up overall speeds because the food staff does not have to wait for students to think of & communicate their order. <br>We employ a way to make sure students have to be in the cafeteria at the time of ordering as well as to stop preordering.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Target Market</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">The target market for our product is school districts or individual schools that have an issue with too long or slow lunch lines. AllenISD is a great <br>example of this. This issue is happening all over the country, so there are numerous opportunities to expand.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">The Competition</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">The competition would be individual restaurants as some of them have their own ordering system. The reason we would be unique however <br>is that most restaurants inside of schools have a different payment system, and their apps would need to be somehow locked down to students.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Revenue Streams</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">SchoolFood will sell our system which includes our app, backend, and support to school districts. We can also charge a small percentage <br>per order (much less than schoolpay) to the students. A one percent fee is almost nothing to students, but will thousands ordering per day, our profits <br>would dramatically increase.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Marketing Techniques</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">We would introduce our product at school conventions such as the Texas Association of School Boards / Texas Association of School Administrators <br>Convention. We will have a marketing video that appeals to potential customers.</p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Expenses</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">
	    <li>Web Hosting</li>
	    <li>Domain Registration</li>
	    <li>Labor - Bug Fixing</li>
	  </p><br>
	  <b style="font-size:23px">Team and Key Roles</b><br>
	  <p style="font-size:17px">There are many roles necessary for this company to succeed. There must be front-end developers, back-end developers, marketing members, etc. <br>Front-End developers are in charge of the user interface - meaning the app mostly. The back-end developers are in charge of the server handling all <br>the requests. It has to have a secure way of payment confirmation, an order queue, a way to connect back to the client (mobile app) to tell the user <br>their food is ready. Marketing is in charge of making our product appealing to potential consumers.</p><br>

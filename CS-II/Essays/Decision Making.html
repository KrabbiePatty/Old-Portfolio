	<div class="articleTitle">Decision Bias</div>
	<div class="articleContent"> <p>Decision bias is a phenomenon that can affect anyone's ability to make decisions, including those made by teams. Decision bias refers to the tendency for individuals or teams to make decisions that are not based on objective, factual information, but rather on personal beliefs, emotions, and other subjective factors. <br><br>
	    There are many different types of decision bias that can impact an individual or team's ability to make effective decisions. Some common examples of decision bias include:
	    <br><br></p>
	</div>
	<div class="articleTitle">1. Confirmation Bias</div>

	<div class="articleContent"><p>This is the tendency to search for, interpret, or remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceived beliefs or hypotheses. For example, a team member who believes that a certain marketing strategy will be effective may selectively seek out information that supports this belief, while ignoring information that suggests the opposite. A way to avoid this bias is by conducting thorough research about contradicting viewpoints. It is also helpful to avoid jumping to conclusions based on limited information, and to avoid making decisions based solely on one's preconceived notions or biases. 
	    <br><br></p>
	</div>
	<div class="articleTitle">2. Anchoring Bias</div>
	<div class="articleContent"><p>This is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information that is presented, even if that information is not relevant or accurate (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). For example, a team may make a decision based on the first piece of data they receive, without considering other factors that could affect the decision. Avoid starting from a single piece of information or anchor when making a decision, and consider multiple sources of information and a range of potential values or outcomes. 
	  </div>
	<div class="articleTitle">3. Loss Aversion</div>
	<div class="articleContent">This is the tendency to avoid taking risks or making decisions that could result in a loss, even if the potential rewards are greater. For example, a team may be hesitant to try a new marketing strategy because they fear that it might fail and result in a loss of revenue. Developing a long-term perspective and focusing on the potential gains rather than the potential losses can help to reduce the impact of loss aversion. Engaging in mindfulness and self-reflection can also help to reduce the emotional impact of potential losses.
	</div>
	<div class="articleTitle">4. Groupthink</div>
	<div class="articleContent">This is the tendency for teams to make decisions that are based on the beliefs or opinions of the group, rather than on individual critical thinking or analysis. For example, a team may agree to a decision simply because everyone else in the group seems to agree, even if the decision is not well-informed or logical. One way that a team can avoid Groupthink is by seeking out diverse viewpoints. By inviting different perspectives into the decision making process, teams can ensure that all relevant information is considered.
	  </div>
	<div class="articleTitle">5. Availability Bias</div>
	<div class="articleContent">This is the tendency for teams to make decisions that are based on the beliefs or opinions of the group, rather than on individual critical thinking or analysis. For example, a team may agree to a decision simply because everyone else in the group seems to agree, even if the decision is not well-informed or logical. It can be helpful to consider the potential reasons why certain information is more readily available, and to take steps to ensure that this does not unfairly influence one's judgment.
	</div>
	<div class="articleTitle">Conclusion</div>
	<div class="articleContent">In summary, it is important to be aware of biases and their impact on decision-making. By taking steps to overcome biases, we can improve the quality of our decisions and make more effective choices.
